# Card Distribution

A simple card distribution game where users input the number of players, and the cards are distributed to them. The result is displayed in the specified format.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the React frontend)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (for the backend)

## Installation

### Frontend (React)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shahrularief/card-distribution.git
   cd frontend-card
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend (PHP)

1. Go to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend-card
   ```

2. Start the PHP server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

   This will start the backend on `http://localhost:8000`.


Once both servers are running, open the frontend in your browser to start the game.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of players.
2. Click "Distribute Cards" to see the distributed cards for each player.
